# etl_group_project
Week 13 group project 

This project was completed by Clay, Mac and Don

The project delivers a database with data about music artist and the number of listeners and scrobbles they currently have as well as data on the history of that artist's success in the Billboard Top 100 charts dating from 2015 to 2019.  

We used 2 different datasources, both from Kaggle.  The Billboard Top 100 data came from https://www.kaggle.com/saberianz/billboard-charts
and the "listener and scobble" data came from https://www.kaggle.com/pieca111/music-artists-popularity.

The download of the music artists database incuded data on all artists that have at least one listener or scrobble (streaming event) and contained well over 1 million artists.  Since this file was too large to load into our github repository we created code in the combined_code jupyter notebook and limited the data to the Top 20000 artists sorted by # of listeners. You can view the original data set here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ouK0pTZxhyrcRDj_yxiKvQ2ZPnA5uwcZ.
